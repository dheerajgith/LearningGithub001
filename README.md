This is the description for the read me file
This is my first full git flow learning expedition. 
The full GitHub workflow   
  
1. **Create a Repository**:  
      
    
    - Initialize a new repository on GitHub or locally using Git.
    - Set up Git locally if you haven't already.
    
      
    
2. **Clone the Repository**:  
      
    - Clone the repository to your local machine to start working on it.
    
3. **Create a Branch**:  
      
    - Create a new branch for your feature or fix. This keeps your changes separate from the main branch.
4. **Make Changes and Commit**:  
      
    - Make changes to the code in your local branch.
    - Commit your changes locally with a descriptive message.
    
5. **Push the Branch**:  
      
    - Push your branch to the remote repository on GitHub. This publishes your changes.
    
3. **Create a Pull Request**:  
      
    - From GitHub, create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch.
    - Add a title and description to explain your changes.
    
4. **Review and Merge**:  
      
    
    - Team members review the pull request.
    - If approved, the pull request is merged into the main branch.
     
5. **Deploy Changes**:  
      
    - Optionally, deploy the changes to a live environment if applicable.
